# Voice chat in Rust
This is the old voice chat from my chat app. It was used before the current audio engine over LiveKit voice implementation. The quality isn't particulary good and it's currently broken if you send the audio over the network, but if you want to get started on a Rust-based voice chat implementation, you might wanna take a look or laugh about my code xd
